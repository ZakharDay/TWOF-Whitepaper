# BitClout’s “The Wall of Fame” Whitepaper

_v1.0.0_

**This document defines The Wall of Fame service model, investment program and terms of use.**

## Context

We believe BitClout is a very unique piece of software that will change the way people interact with each other, will create new social networks and will change history. History of BitClout is the history of people who create it: the BitClout team, many teams who create software on top of BitClout, media and investment project teams, content creators and of course users.

## Project

[The Wall of Fame](https://bitclout.com/u/TheWallOfFame) is a mixed format media (more like a graffiti wall) that can be used for classified advertising, shoutouts, greetings, to mark some moment in history or what else you will create. Buy “paint” (pay for space) and you can write on the wall.

## How it works

The Wall is like an ad billboard or a graffiti wall. On each day of a year the Wall posts one image 512x512 screen pixels we call “Block”. Each Block has an 8x8 pixel step grid that is forming units we call Pixels. Each Pixel costs 0.0001 of our coin.

You can publish any day any time any message, ad or whatever you like that does not violate our Code of Conduct.

### The history of BitClout, crypto art and merchandise

At the end of each month all this month Blocks and a few additional blocks (“Service Blocks”) we combine into one large picture we call Cluster. At the end of a year we combine all Clusters into a super large image we call System. All Clusters and Systems will be minted into NFTs. All Systems will be available in the form of a poster with BitClout history.

### How to make an order

To publish a post to the Wall you need to choose a Block or Blocks where you want to place your publication. As the Wall produces one Block a day you can plan publications for a particular day. Next you need to make an order for the area of your choice on [our Discord channel](https://bit.ly/TWOF-Discord). We will process your order and then send you an invoice with a price in our coin.

### How to buy our creator coins to pay for your publication

We accept payments in our creator coins only which you can buy from one of our ad providers via our [TWOF Exchange Service](https://bit.ly/TWOF-Discord). After we will get your order we will ask our ad providers to sell the amount of our creator coin you need. We will get back to you with a price in $BitClout. After that you will need to transfer us $BitClout to complete the purchase.

### The publication process

You should send us your image to publish at least one day before the day in your purchase. On the day, the Block and the area of your choice you will see your publication.

### Code of Conduct

We made a service for people communication through images and we want that service to be comfortable for all of its users. As the service does not belongs to any jurisdiction and can’t be based on any law, we list our own rules.

We restrict publications contains:

1. Harassment and hateful content;
2. Content that constitutes or promotes violence, harassment, or hatred against people based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity;
3. Content that glorify, celebrate, downplay, or trivialize violence and terrorism;
4. Drug propaganda.

## For investors

[The Wall of Fame](https://bitclout.com/u/TheWallOfFame) project is closed for investment in a classic BitClout way. We offer a well thought-out system that includes an investment program and a financial service model.

The system is designed in accordance with the following requirements:

1. The system should create additional value (the value of the coin is provided by the demand for the service);
2. Investors and the system must be protected from pumps, dumps and rug pullings;
3. The system must be profitable for investors and the service.

### Mechanics used to protect the service

1. The service is always closed from arbitrary investment (100% FR);
2. At the start, the service will selectively give the opportunity to become an investor to the most trusted persons who will be able to increase their grade over time and become majority shareholders;
3. After the release of the first 50 coins, the service will use the following coins to control the cost of services for buyers in order to match purchasing power.

### Mechanics used to protect investors

After the release of the first 50 coins, the service undertakes not to reduce the number of issued coins below 50. Since the maximum number of coins that will be issued to investors is 50, none of the investors will suffer from the decommissioning of coins over 50.

In some cases, there is a possibility that the price of the service and the possible profit will fall, but in this way we will maintain a stable increase in profit.

### The future of the service

If the service becomes more popular, we will direct FR to develop automation systems and reduce service maintenance costs.

### Investment agreement

Each investor undertakes to fulfil the investor's obligations described below. In case of violation of obligations, the investor is excluded from the investment program.

### Increasing coin liquidity and investment scheme

The service will issue the first 15 coins at its own expense and start selling them to one close circle of investors. The profit from the sale minus 10% FR will be reinvested in the creation of new coins, and this process will continue until the mark of 50 issued coins is reached. The profit from the service minus 10% FR will also be reinvested in the creation of new coins.

You can see [this model in the table](http://bit.ly/TWOF-Investment-Program).

### Decision to reduce liquidity

The service reserves the right to reduce the liquidity of the coin in the event of:

1. Decreased purchasing power (if the price is so high that the service will not be used);
2. The need for additional funds for advertising, for the production of NFT, payment for the work of service employees, and any other cases when the service needs funds to pay for something;
3. If investors refuse to sell coins to a buyer, the service burns the number of coins required by the buyer.

### Liquidity reduction procedure

1. The service publishes in the channel for investors a decision on burning coins, indicating the date of burning and the number of coins determined to be burned at least one day before the date of burning (in case of burning due to investors refusing to sell the coin, no warning is required);
2. The service burns coins on the appointed date.

### Profit distribution when burning coins

After the burning procedure, 40% of the profit goes to reward investors. Profit is distributed among investors according to their level:

- 40% for Level 5
- 30% for Level 4
- 20% for Level 3
- 10% for Level 2

### Limitations of liquidity reduction

As part of the investor protection agreement and the minimum number of coins issued, the service undertakes not to reduce the number of issued coins below 50.

### How to become an investor

The service will start its work with the classic for startups investment method — FF (Family & Friends) and will further increase the pool of investors until the planned maximum of 50 coins in the hands of investors is reached.
